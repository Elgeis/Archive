Ozai sees Franko's evasion of justice as an act of war, as he has broken his word to both his own leader, and Ozai.
He had told 0kej, his own leader, that he will go in prison for 5 days and that he will accept the punishment, but frankly, he has now done this, which we find utterly repulsing. What's more offensive is that Emeraldia has accepted this terrorist, who has attacked us, and is currently harboring him, therefore we shall do the most logical thing:

Ozai will be declaring war on Emeraldia.
